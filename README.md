PS: There is a lot of information/commands present in these libraries so. do not get panic that you have to learn everything! You can always google up things when you forget anything! Also, if you are feeling that some part is too much complex then leave that part for now you will understand it as the project progresses and you have much more hands-on-experience! Also, keep discussing your doubts among yourselves.
